        <h2>What is Evolution ?</h2>
        <p>
            Human evolution is the evolutionary process that led to the emergence of anatomically modern humans,
            beginning with the evolutionary history of primates—in particular genus Homo—and leading to the
            emergence of Homo sapiens as a distinct species of the hominid family, the great apes. This process
            involved the gradual development of traits such as human bipedalism and language, as well as
            interbreeding with other hominins, which indicate that human evolution was not linear but a web.

            <p> Viewed zoologically, we humans are Homo sapiens, a culture-bearing upright-walking species that
                lives on the ground and very likely first evolved in Africa about 315,000 years ago. We are now the
                only living members of what many zoologists refer to as the human tribe, Hominini, but there is
                abundant fossil evidence to indicate that we were preceded for millions of years by other hominins</p>

        <h2>Timeline of the evolutionary history of life</h2>
        <p>
            This timeline of the evolutionary history of life represents the current scientific theory outlining the
            major events during the development of life on planet Earth. In biology, evolution is any change across
            successive generations in the heritable characteristics of biological populations. Evolutionary processes
            give rise to diversity at every level of biological organization, from kingdoms to species, and individual
            organisms and molecules, such as DNA and proteins. The similarities between all present day organisms
            indicate the presence of a common ancestor from which all known species, living and extinct, have diverged
            through the process of evolution. More than 99 percent of all species, amounting to over five billion
            species, that ever lived on Earth are estimated to be extinct. Estimates on the number of Earth's
            current species range from 10 million to 14 million, of which about 1.2 million have been documented and
            over 86 percent have not yet been described. However, a May 2016 scientific report estimates that 1
            trillion species are currently on Earth, with only one-thousandth of one percent described.
